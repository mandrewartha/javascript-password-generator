# javascript-password-generator

This random password generator was created by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A series of nested functions and variables were created to ask the prompts that appear once the 'Generate Password' button is pressed. A loop was created with the first prompt to make sure that the user provided the correct input. If statements were used to create a large array based off the prompt choices the user made. A random index was created for that array that provided the correct number of random characters. The generator can be used over and over.
